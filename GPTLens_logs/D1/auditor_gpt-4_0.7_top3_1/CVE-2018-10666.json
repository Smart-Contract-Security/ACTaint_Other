        "vulnerability": "Ownership takeover",
        "reason": "The 'setOwner' function allows to change the owner of the contract without any checks. This means that anyone can take over the contract and become its owner. This is a critical vulnerability that could lead to loss of funds or other malicious actions by an attacker.",

        "reason": "The functions 'transfer' and 'transferFrom' do not prevent zero address (0x0) in their '_to' parameter. This means that tokens can be burnt unintentionally if a user sends tokens to the zero address.",
