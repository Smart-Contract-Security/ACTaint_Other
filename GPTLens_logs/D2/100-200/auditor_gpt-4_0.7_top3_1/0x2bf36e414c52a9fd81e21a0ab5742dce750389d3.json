This order of operations allows the previous owner to potentially re-enter the contract by calling 'changeOwner' again during the Ether transfer, possibly leading to multiple unauthorised state changes and draining of contract funds.",

        "reason": "The function 'killContract' allows anyone to destroy the contract if they send at least 'howManyEtherInWeiToKillContract' Ether to the function.

        "vulnerability": "Unauthorized token minting",
        "reason": "The function 'mintTo' allows any caller to arbitrarily increase the token balance of any address ('_to') by any amount ('_value'). This can lead to uncontrolled inflation of the token supply, distortion of token value, and can potentially be abused by attackers to gain a large number of tokens illegitimately. There are no access control checks (e.g., onlyOwner modifier or similar) limiting the use of this function.",
