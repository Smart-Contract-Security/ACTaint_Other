This could lead to the ownership being transferred to an unintended or zero address, making the contract unusable if the zero address is set as the new owner.",

        "vulnerability": "Improper Authorization",
        "reason": "This function changes the contract owner based on the 'newOwner' variable without additional checks or confirmations from the current owner. An attacker who can trick the owner into setting them as the 'newOwner' can call this function to take over ownership, especially as there is no confirmation mechanism or additional security checks involved.",

        "vulnerability": "Logical Error in Transfer Event",
        "reason": "The Transfer event in this function is misleading because it emits the event with '_firstUnlockAmmount' after it has been set to 0. This results in all Transfer events logging a transfer of 0 tokens, even though tokens have indeed been transferred. This can lead to confusion and incorrect data being shown in logs or on user interfaces interacting with the contract.",
