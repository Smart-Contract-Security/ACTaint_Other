        "reason": "This function allows the 'owner' variable to be reset to the caller (msg.sender) anytime it is called.

        "reason": "Though this function correctly uses the 'onlyOwner' modifier, it does not emit any event or have sufficient logging mechanism to track the change of ownership. This lack of transparency could potentially lead to unnoticed malicious changes in ownership, making it difficult to trace and verify legitimate changes in contract ownership.",

        "vulnerability": "Logical flaw in distribution check",
        "reason": "The function checks if 'totalDistributed' is greater than or equal to 'totalSupply' after it has already distributed tokens, which could potentially allow the 'totalDistributed' to exceed 'totalSupply'. This check should ideally occur before updating 'totalDistributed' to prevent over-distribution beyond the intended supply cap. Moreover, the function is marked as private and does not validate the '_to' address or amount, assuming the calling functions handle these checks.",
