        "vulnerability": "Unauthorized selfdestruct",
        "reason": "The function 'Kill' allows any caller to destroy the contract. The misuse of selfdestruct function without any authorization checks can lead to denial of service where the smart contract is destructed and removed from the Ethereum network.",

        "reason": "Similar to Test2, the function 'Test4' lacks a visibility specifier, making it public by default in Solidity versions before 0.5.0. This can allow any external entity to access internal state variables through the function, which might not have been the developer's intention.",
