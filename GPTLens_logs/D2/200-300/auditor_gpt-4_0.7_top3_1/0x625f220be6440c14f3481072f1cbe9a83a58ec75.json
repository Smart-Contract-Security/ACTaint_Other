        "vulnerability": "Improper balance update",
        "reason": "The function does not update the 'deposits[msg.sender]' mapping after successful withdrawal. This oversight allows the owner to withdraw the same amount repeatedly until the actual balance of the contract is drained, as the checks rely on outdated balance information.",
