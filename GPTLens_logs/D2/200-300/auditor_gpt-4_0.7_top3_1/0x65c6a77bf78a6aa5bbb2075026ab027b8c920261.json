        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "This function includes a call to send Ether to an arbitrary address without following the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern. Specifically, the state variable 'treasury' is updated before sending Ether. An attacker-controlled contract could potentially re-enter the function or another function in the contract that relies on the state of these variables, leading to unexpected behavior or state corruption.",

        "reason": "The function allows the contract to be self-destructed by anyone with the 'owner' role. This could lead to denial of service or other disruptive impacts if misused or if access control is compromised. Moreover, self-destructing contracts permanently removes the code and storage, which can lead to loss of funds or important state information.",

        "reason": "The transfer function relies on an internal function '_transfer' which does not properly manage gas usage. The 'transferCallGas' can be set by an administrator, potentially allowing it to be set to a value that could lead to out-of-gas errors under certain circumstances, disrupting the ability to transfer tokens.",
