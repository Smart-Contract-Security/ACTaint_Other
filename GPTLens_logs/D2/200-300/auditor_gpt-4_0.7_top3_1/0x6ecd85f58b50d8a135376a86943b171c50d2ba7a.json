        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "Although the function uses a 'noReentrancy' modifier intended to prevent reentrancy attacks, the actual execution of the external call to 'receiverAddress.call.value(weiAmount).gas(gasleft().sub(5000))()' can still allow reentrancy. The function changes the state after this call, which can be exploited by an attacker if the receiver address is a malicious contract that calls back into this contract. Even though the function sets `locked = true` at the beginning, subsequent calls can still be made before `locked = false` is executed, leading to potential reentrancy vulnerabilities.",

However, it checks the stage and performs a transfer of ether based on the balance of the sender without using any mutex or reentrancy guard pattern.
