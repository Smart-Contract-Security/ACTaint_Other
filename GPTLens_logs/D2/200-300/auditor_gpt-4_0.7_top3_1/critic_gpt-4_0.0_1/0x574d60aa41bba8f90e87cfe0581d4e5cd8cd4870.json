        "criticism": "The reasoning provided is incorrect as the function uses block.number and not block.timestamp. Block.number is less prone to manipulation compared to block.timestamp. However, the use of blockhash for random number generation is a valid concern, but it's not related to timestamp manipulation. The vulnerability should be described as 'Weak Randomness' due to reliance on blockhash, which can be somewhat predictable. Correctness is low because the described vulnerability does not match the actual issue. Severity is moderate due to potential predictability of winners, and profitability is moderate if an attacker can consistently predict or influence outcomes.",

        "reason": "The settleJackpot function uses block.number to determine if the jackpot time windows are over, and it uses blockhash of dailyStart for random number generation.

This could indeed lead to lost or locked funds if the external call fails.
