However, the severity of this vulnerability is contingent on the implementation of the owner address. If the owner is a contract designed to exploit reentrancy, then the severity is high. Otherwise, it might not be exploitable. The profitability is moderate because exploiting this vulnerability could allow an attacker to drain the contract's funds, but it requires the owner to be a malicious contract, which is a specific condition.",

This is a severe issue as it can lead to a complete loss of the contract and associated data, affecting all stakeholders. The profitability for an attacker is low, as they would need to spend a significant amount of ether (500 ether) to exploit this, which might not be recoverable or beneficial.
