However, the severity is high because if exploited, it could lead to significant financial loss by draining the contract's balance. The profitability is also high for an attacker if they can exploit this vulnerability before it is detected and fixed.",

        "reason": "This function allows an attacker to potentially call the function repeatedly before the first invocation of the function is finished. The function transfers Ether to the current owner, which could be a contract that has a fallback function, leading to reentrancy. This could result in draining the contract's balance before the owner state is updated.",
