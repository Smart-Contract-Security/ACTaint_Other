If any of these addresses is a contract, they might call back into 'withdraw_privatefund' or other functions of this contract and potentially withdraw more funds than they should.",

        "vulnerability": "Arbitrary deadline modification",
        "reason": "The function 'deadline_modify' allows the creator to arbitrarily change the start time and duration of the funding period. This can be exploitable as the creator may prolong the deadline to an unexpected future date after observing poor funding, manipulating the contract's intended behavior and possibly deceiving funders.",

        "vulnerability": "Unauthorized contract termination",
        "reason": "The 'kill' function allows the creator to destroy the contract at any time and send all remaining Ethereum to the 'beneficiary'. There are no checks in place to ensure that all obligations (e.g., returning funds to funders if the deadline has passed without the withdrawal condition being met) are fulfilled before the contract is destroyed, potentially leading to loss of funds for contributors.",
