        "vulnerability": "Incorrect totalSupply manipulation",
        "reason": "The 'pullBack' function is intended to reverse a minting operation by transferring tokens from a buyer back to a wallet. The function increases the 'totalSupply', which is incorrect because it should only transfer existing tokens without affecting the total supply of tokens. This could artificially inflate the token supply, potentially devaluing the token and disrupting the token economy.",

        "reason": "The function 'transferOwnership' allows the current owner to transfer control of the contract to a new owner. However, if the new owner is set to a zero address unintentionally (e.g., through a mistake in the input address), it would lock the contract without an owner since the zero address cannot initiate transactions. This could lead to a loss of control over the contract, making it impossible to perform administrative tasks or recover from other issues.",
