        "reason": "The 'approve' function does not properly prevent a race condition known as the 'approve/transferFrom attack'. An attacker can exploit this by first getting the token holder to approve a certain amount and then changing the approved amount after the holder has made a transfer. This can result in incorrect allowance adjustments if used concurrently.",

        "reason": "The function 'getTokens' does not adequately check if the amount of tokens to distribute will exceed the 'totalSupply' before performing the distribution.
