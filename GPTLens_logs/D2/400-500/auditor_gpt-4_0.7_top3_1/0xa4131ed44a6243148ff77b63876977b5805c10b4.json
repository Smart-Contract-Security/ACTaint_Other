        "reason": "The function transferTokenTo allows the owner to mint an arbitrary amount of tokens to any address by calling doAirdrop.

        "vulnerability": "Integer overflow",
        "reason": "The calculation of tokens in getTokens uses the multiplication of tokensPerEth and msg.value, divided by 1 ether, without validating that the multiplication does not cause an overflow. If the values are large enough, it can lead to an overflow, resulting in fewer tokens being minted than expected, which can be exploited especially if tokensPerEth is set to a high value.",
