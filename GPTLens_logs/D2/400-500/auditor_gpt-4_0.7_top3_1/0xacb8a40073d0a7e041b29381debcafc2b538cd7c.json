        "vulnerability": "Lack of checks on amount to refund",
        "reason": "The function does not check if the amount 'amt' to be refunded is less than or equal to the amount deposited by the address 'addr'. This can lead to negative balances in the contract's 'Available' state variable and allow more ETH to be withdrawn than was deposited.",

        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy via direct ETH transfer",
        "reason": "The function uses 'addr.send(amt)' for transferring ether, which is susceptible to reentrancy attacks. If the address 'addr' is a contract, it can execute fallback function upon receiving ETH and call RefundDeposit again leading to multiple unauthorized withdrawals.",
