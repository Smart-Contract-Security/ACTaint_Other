        "reason": "The getTokens function allows for ETH to be sent and tokens to be received in exchange. The function first calculates the number of tokens to be distributed and then calls distr to transfer these tokens. However, since the state variable 'distributionFinished' is only set after calling distr, this could allow for reentrancy where an attacker could repeatedly call getTokens before distributionFinished is updated, potentially exhausting the token supply.",

        "vulnerability": "Missing zero-value check for approvals",
        "reason": "In the transferFrom function, there is no explicit check for _amount being greater than zero. This can lead to unnecessary gas usage and event emissions when zero tokens are transferred. Moreover, it does not prevent users from setting zero allowances, which could be used to exploit potential bugs in client implementations that do not expect an allowance of zero.",
