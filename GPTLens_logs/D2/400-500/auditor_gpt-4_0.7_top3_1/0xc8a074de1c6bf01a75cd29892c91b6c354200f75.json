        "reason": "The function 'ChangeOwner' lacks an access control mechanism (e.g., 'isOwner' modifier) to ensure that only the current owner can change the ownership of the contract. This allows any external user to take over the contract by changing the owner to their own address.",

        "reason": "The 'transfer' function, when 'feed' is enabled, calculates a fee and then reduces the transfer value by that fee. However, it does not explicitly check if '_value' is greater than 'fee', leading to a potential underflow where '_value - fee' could become a very large number if '_value' is smaller than 'fee'. This can allow users to transfer more tokens than they own.",
