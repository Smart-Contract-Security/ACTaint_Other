        "reason": "The function 'withdraw' does not update the state (reduce the Deposits balance) before sending Ether with 'msg.sender.send(amount)'. An attacker can re-enter the contract and potentially withdraw more Ether than they are allowed, as the balance check and update are not atomic.",

However, it is misnamed and does not match the contract name ('Deposit'), meaning it can be called by anyone at any time, potentially allowing an attacker to reset the 'Owner' address and take control of the contract.",
