        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "In the changeOwner function, the ownership of the contract can be transferred to a new owner if a certain amount of ether is sent. However, before updating the owner state variable, it transfers the entire contract balance to the current owner, which can lead to a reentrancy attack. An attacker can create a fallback function in their contract that calls changeOwner again when it receives ether, potentially draining the contract funds or causing other unintended effects before the ownership change is finalized.",

        "reason": "The killContract function allows anyone to self-destruct the contract by sending a specific amount of ether, bypassing the need for owner authorization.
