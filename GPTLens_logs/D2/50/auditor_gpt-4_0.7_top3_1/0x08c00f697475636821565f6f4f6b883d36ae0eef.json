Constructors should have the same name as the contract or use the 'constructor' keyword. As a result, any user can call this function and change the owner of the contract, leading to unauthorized control.",

If '_to' is an EOA (Externally Owned Account), the function will still attempt to deduct tokens from the sender's balance but will not handle them appropriately on the receiver's end, potentially leading to lost tokens if the receiver is not prepared to handle incoming token data, violating the ERC223 standard.",
