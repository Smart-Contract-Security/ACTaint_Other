Despite the presence of a 'nonReentrant' modifier, the 'kittyCore.transfer' call within the loop can potentially lead to reentrancy. Since the state update 'kittyIsDepositedInContract[kittyToWithdraw] = false;' happens after this call, an attacker can re-enter the contract and manipulate balances or state before the original transaction is complete.",
