        "reason": "The function 'transferAnyERC20Token' allows the owner to transfer any ERC20 tokens held by this contract to themselves. If the owner's account is compromised, the attacker can drain all ERC20 token balances from this contract. This poses a significant risk as there is no checks or limitations on what tokens or how much can be transferred, effectively giving full control to the owner or anyone who gains control of the owner's account.",
