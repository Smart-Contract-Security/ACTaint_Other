        "reason": "The function transferAdminship allows the current admin to transfer the admin role to another address. However, there is no check to validate that the _newAdmin address is not a zero address. Transferring admin rights to a zero address can result in a loss of control over the contract, making it impossible to perform administrative tasks such as freezing accounts or changing the allowed address.",

        "reason": "This function allows the admin to freeze or unfreeze any account at will without any restrictions or checks beyond admin authentication. This action can be used maliciously to deny service to legitimate users or manipulate token dynamics by selectively freezing accounts, potentially disrupting the normal operation of the token.",

        "vulnerability": "Unchecked Return Values",
        "reason": "The transfer function uses the SafeMath library to perform subtraction and addition operations for balance updates. While the SafeMath's sub and add functions include assert statements to prevent overflows, the function itself does not explicitly check the return values to ensure that the operations were successful. Although in this case the use of assert inside SafeMath mitigates this issue, generally ignoring return values can lead to states where transaction failures might not revert overall transaction, leading to inconsistent state in contract.",
