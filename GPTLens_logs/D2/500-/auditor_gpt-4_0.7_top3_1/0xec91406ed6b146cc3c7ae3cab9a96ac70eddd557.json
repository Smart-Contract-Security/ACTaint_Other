Despite being private, it can be indirectly triggered by any user through these public functions.

        "reason": "The 'live' function allows the owner of the contract to trigger the 'close' function, leading to the contract\u2019s self-destruction. This can be a risk if the ownership isn't securely managed or if the owner's account is compromised. Additionally, this function does not have any checks or safety mechanisms to prevent accidental calls, which can permanently destroy the contract.",
