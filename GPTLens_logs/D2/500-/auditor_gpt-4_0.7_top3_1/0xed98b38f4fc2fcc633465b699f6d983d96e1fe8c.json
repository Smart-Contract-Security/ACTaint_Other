        "reason": "The '_transfer' function calls 'initialize' and 'reward' functions that could potentially be used for reentrancy attacks.

If the call to transfer fails (for instance, if the sender is a contract that does not accept ether or the gas stipend is not enough), the entire transaction reverts, including legitimate state changes. This can be used to deny service by deliberately causing transactions to fail.",
