        "reason": "The function 'changeOwner' first transfers all the ETH supplied with the transaction and then the entire balance of the contract to the current owner before changing the owner state variable. The use of 'owner.transfer()' could be exploited by a malicious contract if the 'owner' is a contract. This contract could, in turn, call back into any function of GIFTO, potentially when the owner state is not yet updated, leading to reentrancy attacks.",
