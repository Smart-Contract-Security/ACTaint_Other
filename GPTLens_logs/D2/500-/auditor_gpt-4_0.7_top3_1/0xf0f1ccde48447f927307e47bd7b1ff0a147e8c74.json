        "vulnerability": "Authorization through tx.origin",
        "reason": "The function 'zSetDisabled' uses msg.sender to check if the caller is the owner or the creator of the entry to authorize the action. However, if the function invocation is part of a transaction initiated by a contract, msg.sender would be that contract's address, not the original EOA (externally owned account). This could potentially allow a malicious contract to disable entries if it can get a legitimate address to interact with it first.",

        "reason": "The use of 'selfdestruct' in the 'zKill' function can lead to denial of service by permanently removing the contract from the blockchain when executed by the owner. This action cannot be reversed, and all contract data is removed, potentially leading to loss of critical business or operational data.",
