        "reason": "The function name 'constuctor' is a typographical error and should be 'constructor'. This error means the constructor will not set the owner upon contract deployment, leaving the contract without a designated owner. This makes all functions protected by the onlyOwner modifier accessible to anyone, as the ownership check will fail.",

        "reason": "The function 'addComment' allows any user to add a comment without any restrictions. Since this function is not protected by the onlyOwner modifier or any other form of access control, malicious users can flood the contract with irrelevant or harmful comments, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS) by filling up storage or degrading the contract's usability.",

        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted access control",
        "reason": "Like 'addComment', the function 'setComment' lacks any form of access control. This allows any external caller to modify any comment stored in the contract.
