        "reason": "The function 'withdrawTokenTo' makes an external call to an arbitrary address 'token' using the low-level 'call' method. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the target contract is malicious or contains bugs, potentially allowing reentrancy attacks or other malicious actions.",

        "vulnerability": "Incorrect Withdrawal Logic",
        "reason": "The function 'withdraw' uses 'Deposits[msg.sender]' to check the withdrawal limit, where 'msg.sender' should be the owner due to the 'onlyOwner' modifier. This confusion in access control can lead to the owner being able to withdraw funds deposited by other users, not just their own funds, since 'Deposits' mapping is supposed to track individual user balances, not the owner's.",

        "vulnerability": "Unauthorized Self-Destruct",
        "reason": "The 'kill' function allows the contract to be destructed by anyone as long as the contract balance is zero. Although it checks for zero balance, it does not check if the sender is the owner or has appropriate permissions to kill the contract, leading to potential denial of service if someone can empty the contract balance and then call this function.",
