        "vulnerability": "Incorrect modifier",
        "reason": "The modifier 'onlyOwner' in the Manageable contract is intentionally set to always fail by having 'require(true == false);'.

        "vulnerability": "Missing input validation",
        "reason": "This function lacks validation on the _tokenIndex input, which is used to directly access array elements such as 'totalTokenAmounts', 'dealtPrices', 'completedTokenAmounts', and 'subStatuses'. If an out-of-bounds _tokenIndex is supplied, this could lead to an array out-of-bounds exception, causing transaction reversion. Moreover, unchecked access could be exploited leading to denial of service (DoS) or unintended overwrites in the contract's storage.",

        "reason": "Similar to the first vulnerability, this function is intended to allow resetting the 'orderId' to a specific number. However, it uses the 'onlyOwner' modifier which, due to its faulty implementation in the Manageable contract ('require(true == false);'), will always fail and prevent this function from executing successfully. This prevents any management or reset operation on the 'orderId', potentially leading to operational issues or halted functionalities.",
