        "reason": "The 'setTarget' function allows the target address of delegatecalls to be changed. Since this function is protected only by the 'auth' modifier, if there are flaws or bypasses in the authorization scheme (e.g., if the 'owner' account is compromised), an attacker could redirect delegatecalls to any arbitrary contract, which can lead to severe security vulnerabilities such as loss of funds or unintended execution of harmful logic.",

        "reason": "The 'mint' function in 'MemeToken' modifies the state after calling an external contract through 'super._mint'. This could be exploited by a reentrant attack if the external contract called is malicious or compromised, allowing it to call back into 'mint' or other functions in 'MemeToken' before the initial execution completes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or state corruption.",
