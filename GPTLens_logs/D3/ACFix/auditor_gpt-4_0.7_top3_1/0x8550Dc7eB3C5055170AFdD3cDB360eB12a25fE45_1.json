        "vulnerability": "Reentrancy",
        "reason": "The 'cross' function is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks because it calls an external contract 'token.transferFrom' before updating the state. An attacker could exploit this by creating a malicious contract that calls 'cross' during the execution of 'transferFrom', leading to multiple withdrawals.",
