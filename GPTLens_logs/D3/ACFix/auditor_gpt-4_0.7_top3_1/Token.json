        "vulnerability": "Unrestricted Minting",
        "reason": "The mint function allows any caller to mint tokens without restrictions, resulting in potential hyperinflation and devaluation of the token. This can be exploited by attackers to grant themselves an arbitrary amount of tokens, which can be leveraged to manipulate the token economy or exploit other parts of the system relying on the token's value.",

        "code": "function decimals() public view virtual override returns (uint8) { return 6; }",
        "vulnerability": "Inconsistent Decimal Definition",
        "reason": "The 'decimals' function in the Token contract overrides the same function in the ERC20 contract to return a different value (6 instead of 18). This inconsistency can lead to calculation errors in other contracts or applications that interact with this token, expecting the standard 18 decimals used by most ERC20 tokens. This can result in significant financial discrepancies and potential loss.",

        "vulnerability": "Unchecked minting amount",
        "reason": "The _mint function does not have a check to limit the amount being minted. This can be exploited if an external publicly accessible function (like 'mint') calls this internal function, allowing minting of arbitrary amounts of tokens, affecting the token's total supply and potentially leading to inflation or other economic impacts.",
