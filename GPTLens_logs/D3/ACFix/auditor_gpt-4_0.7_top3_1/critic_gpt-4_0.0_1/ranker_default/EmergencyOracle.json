This could be a significant issue if the smart contract serves as a price oracle for other dependent systems, as it could lead to manipulated asset pricing. However, this is more of a design flaw than a vulnerability unless the contract is intended to have checks that were omitted. The severity is high if the oracle influences significant financial decisions, but profitability for an external attacker is low since only the owner can exploit this.",

If the owner's account is compromised, it could indeed lead to misuse of the oracle. However, the severity is somewhat overstated as the function itself is designed to be controlled by the owner, which is a common pattern in smart contracts.
